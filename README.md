# Belly Button Biodiversity

https://albertov5.github.io/tec-data-12-plotly

In this project, we had the task of developing a webpage with data visualization for a dataset of belly button biodiversity. The data was loaded from a JSON file and we were able to dynamically generate multiple charts, including bar, gauge and bubble. 

## Results

We were able to add CSS styling, new HTML layout elements and all the Javascript parts of the page work without problems.
